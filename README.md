# Multiclass Classification Using Softmax From Scratch
My implementation of the Multiclass Classification with numerically stable softmax and cross-entropy functions from scratch and using it to tackle the problem of Handwritten Digit Recognition. To get a deeper understanding I've decided **not to use** any famous libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc. But, used the NumPy library for Vectorization.

I've used the [**MNIST**](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database of handwritten digits for the project.
For more details on **numerically stable** Softmax and Cross Entropy refer to [this blog](https://jaykmody.com/blog/stable-softmax/).


## Instructions:
1) Install python3 on your systems.
2) Use python pip to install the following packages:
    > pip install numpy
    
3) Run the script using:
   > python3 main.py
