# Handwritten Digit Recognition From Scratch
My implementation of the Multiclass Classification problem of Handwritten Digit Recognition. To get a deeper understanding I've decided **not to use** any famous libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc. But, used the NumPy library for Vectorization.

I've used the [**MNIST**](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database of handwritten digits for the project.
